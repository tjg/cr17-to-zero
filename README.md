# cr17-to-zero

This project is place where we, the Clojure Community, can document our conversation and code relating to a 'conversation' I have proposed for [Clojure Remote 2017](https://clojureremote.com/).

The core topic is about how we can creatively strengthen mentor/apprentice relationships within programming circles at large, and more specifically, within Clojure.

If you're interested in learning more, please see the file [notes.org](https://github.com/webappzero/cr17-to-zero/blob/master/notes.org) in the root of this project. I'll be blogging about this topic frequently at [webappzero.com](http://webappzero.com).

My best,  
Jay
